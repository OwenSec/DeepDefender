Implementations of Carlini and Wagner's attacks can be found online. Following the [instructions](https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks), you will be able to get those attacks up and running on most Linux-based systems.

The 100 ImageNet test set can be obtained [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TfrJzb5rBqKC5CkKiG93vg).

Replace setup_inception.py in [nn_robust_attacks project](https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks) with modified_setup_inception.py to read experiment datasets.
