# DeepDetector
In this repository, we propose and implement a straightforward method for detecting adversarial image examples. The method can efficiently detect adversarial examples crafted by [Fast Gradient Sign Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf), [DeepFool method](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Moosavi-Dezfooli_DeepFool_A_Simple_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) and [attacks designed by Nicholas Carlini and David Wagner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04644.pdf). Adversarial examples crafted by other attack techniques may also can be detected by our method.<br>
Details of the three attack techniques mentioned above and the corresponding implementations of our method can be found in each subdirectories, namely, FGSM Detector, DeepFool Detector and CW Detector.<br> 
Subdirectory ImageNetImages contains four classes (Zebra, Panda, Cab and Pineapple) of images from ImageNet dataset, which are used for our experiments.
