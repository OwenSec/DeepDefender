In the training phase, we use the FGSM attack to determine the detection scheme.
To run the code, the [CleverHans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) project and the [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) project need to be correctly configured first.

The ImageNet training set can be obtained [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1juWft0d-xjYon5LBMRuBGg).
